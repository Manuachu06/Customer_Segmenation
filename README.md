## Background

Customer segmentation involves dividing a customer base into groups of individuals who share similar characteristics or behavior. Businesses can use these segments to tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer experiences, and optimize product offerings. K-Means clustering is a popular technique for achieving this segmentation.

## Installation

To get started with this project, follow the installation steps outlined in the requirement document. It includes instructions for setting up the required environment and dependencies.

## Usage

The project provides detailed instructions on how to perform customer segmentation using K-Means clustering. It covers data preprocessing, model training, and segment visualization.

## Dataset

This project utilizes a dataset containing customer information and purchase history. You can find information about the dataset and how to access it in the [Dataset] repository section.

## K-Means Clustering

The [K-Means Clustering](/docs/k-means-clustering.md) document explains the fundamentals of K-Means clustering, including how it works and how to choose the optimal number of clusters (K).

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in customer segmentation. The steps required to clean and prepare the data for clustering are taken in this project.

## Results and Insights

Libraries like matplotlib,pyplot,seaborn are used to gain insights from the data.
