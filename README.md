# Customer_Segmenation
Customer segmentation using K-means is a data analysis technique that divides a customer base into distinct groups or clusters based on their similarities in various features or characteristics. K-means clustering aims to identify patterns and relationships within customer data to enable businesses to better understand their customers and tailor their marketing and service strategies accordingly. It works by iteratively grouping customers into clusters where each customer in a cluster is more similar to others in the same cluster than to those in other clusters. This helps organizations target their marketing efforts, optimize product offerings, and enhance customer experiences based on the unique needs and preferences of each segment, ultimately leading to improved customer satisfaction and business success.
